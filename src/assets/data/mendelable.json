L'origine du symbole N est son nom latin nitrogenium qui provient du grec nitron gennan, ce qui signifie « formateur de salpêtre » (nitrate de potassium). Le terme anglais nitrogen a conservé cette racine pour désigner l'azote, alors que le terme français « nitrogène » n'est plus utilisé de nos jours."

Le symbole du sodium, Na, vient du nom latin d'un composé du sodium appelé natrium, qui lui-même vient du grec νίτρον (nitron), un carbonate de sodium naturel (le natron).

La présence dans l’air de l’argon fut suspectée par Henry Cavendish dès 1785 mais sa découverte par Lord Rayleigh et Sir William Ramsay attendit 1894.
